## Reflection on _Closed systems: Generative art and Software Abstraction_ by Marius Watz. (2008)

This article by Marius Watz touches many points. First of all, he mentions the potential downfall of generative art: the infamous screensaver. This word alone generates anxiety to young media artists like me, how not to fall into this category when engaging in generative processes? What is the limit between being/making or not a screensaver? Watz offers one possible answer: pixels are not the sole medium for generative art. Indeed, his final example concerns Lab[au] architectural pieces that extend the computer screen while still using programming principles.

Another relevant aspect of this article is the idea of programming errors and emergence. By making (compilable) errors, one can discover unexpected behaviors. And this is true in so many fields. In medicine, for instance, a lot of discoveries are known to have been made by pure accident. This reminds me of this great talk by [Sir Ken Robinson](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity?language=en) about how school teaches us that mistakes (and therefore explorations) are wrong. Since I began programming creatively, I feel that I am relearning the exact opposite every day and it's hard!

## Reflection on _PLAYING A GAME OF GANSTRUCTION_ by Helena Sarin. (2019)
Helena Sarin is a beautiful example of an artist who does not stop where everyone else has. Her philosophy to use technology to see things differently is remarkable in all her work. I have seen so many people using GANs as it is without understanding or thinking about the actual implications of such technology. But with Sarin it's different, it's deeply poetic.

She describes herself as a curator, a collector and a gardener: three occupations that require a lot of observation, patience, and attention. It tells a lot about the ways she engages with her work and how she doesn't take technology for granted. Art involving machine learning needs humans!


## Reflection on _The new role of the designer in generative design_ by Che-Wei Wang (CW&T). (2018)
Che-Wei Wang talking about the importance of adding humans in the loop of technological processes such as machine learning relates to the reason why I find Helena Sarin so inspiring. He believes that artists and designers but also people, in general, have to understand what is happening "inside the box". As mentioned by Wang, this is mandatory in order to protect our societies against bias and corruption and, less dramatically, to understand the complex world we live in and its potential.   

## Reflection on __ by Memo Akten. (2018)
Memo Akten makes another argument that supports the graph introduced by Helena Sarin: "as you get towards the end of the spectrum, you’ll need to work harder to give it a unique spin and make it your own." The end of the spectrum being the one that requires less effort in order to use machine learning. Therefore being innovative in this field is either diving into the subject and understanding how it works or having a REALLY good idea about something superficial. I tend to agree with that.

His work developing new means of creativity for individuals to explore is also very compelling. Akten is another example whose deep comprehension of the subject matter, here machine learning, allows us to make things that shows the world of technology with new perspectives.

## Personal notes

with the tension between organic and mechanical forms ever-present. A common challenge in computational aesthetics is the simulation of organic behavior and spontaneous irregularities, phenomena that appear in nature without prompting but which can only be replicated by computers with the explicit encoding of such behavior

The process of abstracting aesthetic processes into executable computer code requires formal stringency and a talent for reverse-engineering a desired result in order to identify its causal elements.

Programming errors can lead to serendipitous discoveries, and one does well to embrace
one’s mistakes.

Generative art requires that the artist be able to express herself through the manipulation of these systems, choosing computational strategies and appropriate parameters in a combination of technical skill and aesthetic intuition.


: Firstly, that it does not in fact
constitute an art movement as such. Rather it describes a strategy for the invention of works that share a
certain methodology, but which may present themselves in myriad ways. Secondly, the aesthetic application of rules comes with a wealth of historical precedents, dating back as far as humans have been known
to employ scientific principles.

Generative art
is primarily interested in closed system, self-contained constructs investigated for their formal and material qualities. This might seem like a trivial difference, but it places the concerns of generative art closer to
traditions of drawing or painting than to the relational aesthetics so common in the media art field.

The famous screensaver analogy..

The use of digital fabrication technology to literally extrude virtual objects into physical space challenges the screen as a default output device, providing the means
for an algorithmic conception of space.

Pixel is not the sole medium for generative art!!

generative design: good when you have rules/numbers to follow
neural network: can be trained on fuzzy variables: like aesthetic.
natural language processing: reading/understanding documents

Wow... scary..
People are very close to be their own designer
robots will take your job
Could influence election

Problems:
- look always the same
- we need to be critical in data that we use choose oy use

we need more inclusive loops.
human need to be part of the process
We need to unblackboxed.

Personally, I think it is possible to make interesting work around each of these poles (and I have tried every single one!). But as you get towards the end of the spectrum, you’ll need to work harder to give it a unique spin and make it your own.

Obvious seems to be going down the ‘can a machine make art?’ angle.

And it’s impossible for me to know or see or ‘empathize’ with what you see. And of course, this is actually always the case, not just in this VR experience, but in daily life, in everything that we experience. We just forget that and assume that everybody experiences the world in the same way we do.

It’s a collaboration with Google (the search engine, not people working at Google), the keeper of our collective consciousness. And actually it’s more a collection of prayers.
