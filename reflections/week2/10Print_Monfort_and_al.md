### Personal Notes
Regularity
Mazelike pattern commodor 64's. This pattern is connected to the tradition of craft particularly pattern base crops such as needlework and ornamental design.
This pattern is also connected to the creation of complex pattern using repeated procedures and a small number of elements.
Computer is a site of procedural crafts that can be explained when looking the time is it was developed during taylorism and fordism. So the intersection of craft and computation is not accidental.

Repetition in space
The grid provides a framework within which human intuition and invention can operate and that the Jen subvert.

I think that to be petitioned in art is but very fruitful process.
It makes me think communication in statistics.

Textiles and crafts
The idea of creating patterns out of simple variations of shapes came across many forms of design particularly ornaments. Computers allow the automation of the repetitive process, that's the difference with needlework for example.

While needlework instructions demonstrate the role of repeated process and pattern over somewhat regulated space, the loom regulates time and space without in effect repeating the process.

Does this mean that computing it's kind of a declarative art.

The Grid in Modern Art
Concrete art is work that Is conceived without reference to Nature and symbolism. This is defined by Van doesBurg.

Vera molnar using method that she called imaginary machine.

Would the Vietnam War and social movements of the late sixties and early seventies the emphasis within Visual Arts community had moved away from minimalism and constructivism to focus back on expressive and realistic painting.

The computer screen
The computer screen is a grid made of an array of pixels.

Repetition in time
The temporal regularity is the result of a repeated process like a clock ticking or a person climbing. Time is not only there to set to the hours but also to give a regular rhythm to an action. Time also implies the possibility of motion. Artists like Naum Gabo in the twenties created kinematic sculptures.

Performance artist also embraced the repetition of movements. Balut like the one in 10 print can Be Imagined as a film strip. Music composers also base their work on repetition. People like Steve Reitch.

It's very fascinating to realize how repetition is for Rich concept for art making.

Repetition in process
The regularity is necessary 4 computers to work, artists are using regularity as a style and technique.

Medium the computer is able to repeat endlessly a command.
Iterative process is a form of bounded Loop.
