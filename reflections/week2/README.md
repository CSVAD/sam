## Reflection on Regularity in 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5 + RND(1));:GOTO 10 by Nick Monfort and al

### Response
This chaper of _10 PRINT_ is extremely relevant by the plentiful references it gives to the readers. Ranging from early craft to modern art to programming, it traces a clear path to understand the impact of regularity in creative practices. Second, the link it creates between craft and computation can once again be connected. The richness of this concept expands to space, time and processes, therefore, it can be at the basis of needlework and programming as much as dance and performance. It feels like if creative practices feed one another as one concept (here the concept of regularity) becomes highly agile within the art. This permutability between medium allows different species of artists to communicate through their work.

More specifically, the strong tie between computing and decorative craft, such as needlework can be strengthen by the fact that, traditionally, both were executed by women. Women would be retrograded to repetitive tasks. It was true in the art world, the article "Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?" by Linda Nochlin in 1971 pointed it out rather clearly, and it was true in the tech world, remember the first [ENIAC programmer](https://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/298369/ENIAC-Programmers-Kathleen-McNulty,-Mauchly-Antonelli,-Jean-Jennings-Bartik,-Frances-Synder-Holber-Marlyn-Wescoff-Meltzer,-Frances-Bilas-Spence-and-Ruth-Lichterman-Teitelbaum/): only women. So maybe, there is something deeply social as well in regularity?


### Personal Notes
*Regularity*
Mazelike pattern Commodore 64's. This pattern is connected to the tradition of craft particularly pattern base crops such as needlework and ornamental design.

This pattern is also connected to the creation of complex pattern using repeated procedures and a small number of elements.
Computer is a site of procedural crafts that can be explained when looking the time is it was developed during taylorism and fordism. So the intersection of craft and computation is not accidental.


*Repetition in space*
The grid provides a framework within which human intuition and invention can operate and that they can subvert.

Using repetition in art is a very fruitful process.
It makes me think of permutation in statistics.

*Textiles and crafts*
The idea of creating patterns out of simple variations of shapes came across many forms of design particularly ornaments. Computers allow the automation of the repetitive process, that's the difference with needlework for example.

While needlework instructions demonstrate the role of repeated process and pattern over somewhat regulated space, the loom regulates time and space without in effect repeating the process.

Does this mean that computing it's kind of a declarative art?

*The Grid in Modern Art*
Concrete art is work that is conceived without reference to Nature and symbolism. This is defined by Van doesBurg.

Vera Molnar using method that she called imaginary machine.

Would the Vietnam War and social movements of the late sixties and early seventies the emphasis within Visual Arts community had moved away from minimalism and constructivism to focus back on expressive and realistic painting.

*The computer screen*
The computer screen is a grid made of an array of pixels.

*Repetition in time*
The temporal regularity is the result of a repeated process like a clock ticking or a person climbing. Time is not only there to set to the hours but also to give a regular rhythm to an action. Time also implies the possibility of motion. Artists like Naum Gabo in the twenties created kinematic sculptures.

Performance artist also embraced the repetition of movements. Balut like the one in 10 print can Be Imagined as a film strip. Music composers also base their work on repetition. People like Steve Reitch.

It's very fascinating to realize how repetition is for Rich concept for art making.

*Repetition in process*
The regularity is necessary 4 computers to work, artists are using regularity as a style and technique.

Medium the computer is able to repeat endlessly a command.
Iterative process is a form of bounded Loop.
