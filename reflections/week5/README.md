## Reflection on _Stop Drawing Dead Fish_ by Bret Victor. (2013)

I find myself reacting a lot to Bret Victor's presentation: both agreeing and disapproving what he is explaining. The idea of striving to find the essence of a computer as a medium is interesting but the claim that anything not unique is not worth pursuing seems exaggerated. It's true that the interactiveness available through the computer gave birth to the video game as a form of art. This specific property, Victor calls it simulation or responsiveness.

Bret Victor also mentions that code is not a truly artistic way to create behaviors. I disagree on the basis that creativity comes from more than one place. Fair enough, if he prefers body movements as a source of expression, but some other minds favor mathematical equations, logic gates, and words.

Besides some elitist comments, the idea of performing the computer medium is one close to my artistic practice. I have begun questioning video games as a mean for performance so I am very intrigued by Victor's software. I feel that interactive art as still to be explored. Through platforms such as Twitch, video games have become much more than solitary entertainment.

I feel that dead fish are still relevant.

## Reflections on _Dynamic Pictures_ by Bret Victor. (2011)

_With today's tools, dynamic design requires creating pictures by writing text. It is only because we are so accustomed to this situation that we don't recognize how bizarre, even barbaric, it is._

Barbaric??? I understand his point of view but I believe that there is more than one way to express creativity.







## Just some notes for myself

Game are a precedent. Only exist in a computer. Didn't exist before. What is it about computer that enable the video game. Simulation: digital responding to. responsiveness.

Behavior is the essence of the computer as an art medium. So when we do art . Not native art.

What happen when art and artist are alive.

Performance. Expressiveness.

Listening to the body. More emotional expressiveness?

Write code to teach how to behave.
Inappropriate.

1. we cant see the art
2. artist want to express smt not related
