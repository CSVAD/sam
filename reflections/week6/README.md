## Reflection on _User Interface: A Personal View_ by Alan Kay. (1989)
In the words preceding the article, I learned that Alan Kay is the person behind the idea of iconic graphical representations of computing functions and that he was inspired by psychology theories, the capacity for learning and the importance of images and symbols in understanding complex concepts. This endeavor into the mind was outbreaking within the human-computer interaction field.

Alan Kay realizes that the computer is a medium. And, based on McLuhan's _Understanding Media_, a medium as the power to transform Society. It's important that Kay was aware of these impacts on people and that he didn't take it lightly.

Kay made the connection: new interfaces would be connected to learning. So he based his interfaces on the order of learning "first kinesthetically, then iconically and finally the intuitive knowledge".


## Reflections on _Instrumental Interaction: An Interaction Model for Designing Post-WlMP User Interfaces_ by Michel Beaudouin-Lafon. (2000)
This article is a good overview of the wimp interface. I was not aware that wimp stands for windows, icons, menus, and pointing. And never thought of computer interaction in such a specific way. Beaudoin-Lafon, though, prioritizes direct manipulation and shares some principles about this type of manipulation.

The first rule is to always have the object of interest represented. And the second rule is to favor physical actions on an object rather than complex syntax. The third rule concerns incremental and reversible operations and the last rule implies a layered approach to learning. The author argues that elements such as menus dialog boxes and scroll bars mediate the objects of interest to the users, which generates a lack of engagement. Therefore the aim of instrumental interaction is to try to develop tools that resemble as much as possible the physical world.

This is a very interesting framework to interface design, but I feel skeptical about the intense focus on direct manipulation of the object of interest. I believe that some alternative ways to interact with an object can actually improve our understanding of that object. The scale developed by the author that includes integration, indirection, and compatibility seems a relevant and pragmatic manner to define differences between different tools. But I wouldn't say that some are better than the others, they're just different ways to interact.

## Reflection on _Alternative Programming Interfaces for Alternative Programmers_ by Toby Schachman. (2012)

Toby Schachman describes user interfaces as being physical, conceptual and social. He notices that their physical aspect is often focused on the text medium. The keyboard is one of the main ways to interact with computers for instance. He argues that we should continue striving to develop alternatives to this mode of interaction using the full capacity of our technologies. I totally agree with that and always wanted to design a choreographic way to code for the same reason stated by Schachman: doing things through new perspectives, using different parts of our brain, can enhance our use of technology and lead to new discoveries.

The conceptual interface is basically the semantics of programming languages while the social interfaces concerns who and how should we program. From these characteristics, new questions arise. Schachman notes that nowadays more people who do not consider themselves as programmers begin to code, and these individuals are often design or art-oriented. The way they understand and use software is different from classic programmers and should be embraced in the interfaces.

Schachman suggests what he calls a "two-way causality flow": "instead of specifying a compiler, the programming interface specifies a constraint solver." This two-way flow implies that the programmer can change the objects of interest which will modify the code in return.

Though I understand the endeavor, I can foresee a lot of technical problems out of this. Plus, the translation between programming languages and visual outputs feels actually beneficial to my personal artistic workflow.




## Just some notes for myself
Rules:
1. Object of interest should be present at all time. Menu bar, toolbar, floating palettes occlude significant part of the screen.
2. physical actions on objects vs complex syntax

Post-WIMP Interaction = more faithful to principles of direct manipulation.
