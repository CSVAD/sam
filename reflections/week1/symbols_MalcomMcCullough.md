## Reflection on Symbols from Abstracting Craft by Malcolm McCullough (1997)

### Response

Malcom McCullough's formal exploration of symbols marries gracefully the notions of craft and digital aesthetic. Coming out of this reading felt like the act of massaging data through software could result in a hybrid sculptural form both physical and virtual. Like a play dough consisting of 0s and 1s. Thinking of digital craft as a "reflective consciousness" applied to "the practice of habitual computer-based work" is particularly compelling. This definitely opens up new ways to understand this creative field, as a medium comparable to other medium such as painting and sculpture.

Since programming is a language, it makes sense to treat it with analytical tools. McCullough gives us a scheme to think, interpret, and analyze computational art, a symbolic scheme. But he acknowledges himself the limits of that scheme: the lack of consciousness, of intent, in approaching digital craft solely through a formal notation. This space that differs from conventional programming seems to be where art resides.

Still today, digital art, somehow, is not well understood. People that are not directly connected to the field still think that it only consists of video game making or website design. Computation as a medium has not yet reached global consciousness. Maybe it's just a matter of understanding generative structures as a material? Next time someone asks me what do I do, I'll reply that, like a painter with paint or a sculptor with clay, I manipulate data.   


### Personal Notes
Symbols by Franciscus Vieta.

Possibility to manipulate a concept in an abstract manner. p.3

Context and structure shape the use of symbols.

Relieved from any requirement for affinity, symbol becomes the sign.

Leibniz, logic would help solve the misunderstanding resulting from multiplicities of language.

*Formal Notation*
symbol system consisting of a symbol scheme unambiguously correlated with a field of reference.

A symbol scheme is generally a set of distinct characters plus a syntax for combining them.

This is according to Nelson Goodman.

Maybe programming is similar to making music authorship and execution or not United.
It's different for painting.

For Goodman, painting is autographic. Music is allographic.

Traditional crafts lack notation. With notation an object is reproducible.

*Structure*
Formal notation invites the study of structure. In natural language consists of grammar.

*Abstraction in data structure*
Computing is essentially the use of symbolic notation on a huge range of skills.
A data structure organizes symbols for specific purposes.
Data abstraction is possible through object-oriented.

*Generative structure*
Software design is a matter of defining an appropriate structure for serving a task or problem.  
Generative structure is the beginnings of a medium largely because it invites manipulation.
The computer as a medium.
The structures we manipulate are more than collections of elements they additional context for action.
Creatives give special emphasis to generative structure.
Some says: Data is like paint for computer creatives.

All languages can be studied in terms of formal structure. Even the most expressive and subtlest languages can be studied in terms of formal structure including the languages of poetry painting sculpture and music. This is the platonic and universalist position of Holtzman. This vision is not shared by academic theory but is welcome to approach digital aesthetic. The power of generative structures can be realized through the complimentary role of personal sensibility. This need also to be acknowledged.

*The limits of structured symbolic thinking*
Howard Gardner: Became the most articulate advocate of symbolic processing models of mind, he has taken a special interest in the role of symbolic systems in creativity. According to him, the basic unit of human thoughts is the symbol. And humans operate in a meaningful context are symbol systems.

Of course this very obsession with externalized knowledge has stigmatized this research in the eyes of traditionally creative people. (Page 104)

There seems to be a problem with symbolic systems that are completely context-free. Numerical models have the unfortunate disadvantage of containing no information about when their contents are appropriate.

*Inspiration and intent*
On biological naturalism. If in essence consciousness is natural, and neither we nor our technology should ignore it, then more advanced conditions of design computing should differ from algorithmic industrial machine operation precisely by reflectivity and intent.

A tool conducts intent, a medium forms a background of possibilities, and the two are inseparable.

Digital craft is to will some sort of reflective consciousness in the practice of habitual computer-based work.

It is as if vision, thought, work, all occur on the Spectrum.

*Achieving a balance*
Symbolic processing is too powerful to ignore, but not powerful enough to rely upon exclusively.

After all, only human beings will make computing humane. Humans like to use their hands at least as much as their brains. If there is a digital aesthetic to be had, getting there may well be a matter of abstracting crafts.
