## Reflection on Cybernetics, art and ideas: Introduction by Jasia Reichardt

### On preconception
electronic engineers == clever but uncreative.
artists == creative but no technical skills.

mostly true according to the author. Says that today assumption s are less accurate (because of computer-aided creative design)

interesting how Cybernetic Serendipity is described, not an exhibition nor a technological fun fair. A hybrid perhaps?

The controversial questions: wheter a computer thinks or wether it will replace man. Young audience would not think about that.

"The stronghold of art and technology is discouraged"...

2 texts in parallel:
Intellect has its own pleasure. but these are not a substitute for a direct emotional response.

To this day, not a single master piece made to the principles of generative aesthetics. ** Casey Reas

computer arts for those who are concerned with:
- pemutational procedures
- serial techniques
- transformation of images

Instrument of democracy?
Abraham Moles dismisses the authenticity of a work of art ..

foreigners, computers and poets = unexpected linguistic associations


## Response

Reichardt's first statement is very compelling to me.

> One thing that foreigners, computers and poets have in common is that they make unexpected linguistic associations.

As a foreigner, I often found that unintended feature shameful.
