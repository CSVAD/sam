## Reflection on Cybernetics, art and ideas: Introduction by Jasia Reichardt


### Response

_Cybernetics, art and ideas_ was published in 1971 and, nevertheless, some issues raised by Jasia Reichardt are still applicable today. We have not reached yet a technological state where art and science cohabit effortlessly. Reichardt mentions that "the stronghold of art and technology is discouraged." Though words such as "interdisciplinary" and "multidisciplinary" have become mainstream, it often feels more like a facade than a rigorous endeavor. In a society of hyper-specialization, allying art and science like Renaissance masters is not that easy (.. think of [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal), the French physicist, theologian, mathematician, writer.. this guy just did everything!?). Today's culture of knowledge seems more involved with the specific rather than the intersections between different fields. When talking to fellow PhD students, particularly in science, it is hard to understand what they are actually working on without a deep background in physics, neuroscience or molecular biology.

Reichardt also points out that "the point [in experimenting with computer art] is nothing less than the measure of possibilities in the future." This seems profoundly true. Experimenting with new technology in creative and artistic manners is a way to question the future socially, culturally and politically.  

But despite some contemporary ideas, some passages shared in this article feel old and those are also worth noticing. Reichardt affirms that no masterpiece has been made on the basis of generative aesthetics (p.14). Looking at work done by [Casey Reas](http://reas.com/p20_s2/), [Zack Lieberman](https://www.instagram.com/zach.lieberman/) or [Lisa Jevbratt](https://rhizome.org/art/artbase/artwork/infome-imager-lite/) (her piece _Infome Imager Lite_ seems down at the moment), work that has been exhibited in gallery and museum across the world, it appears obvious that generative art as its place in the art world today.

### Personal notes
electronic engineers == clever but uncreative.
artists == creative but no technical skills.

mostly true according to the author. Says that today assumption s are less accurate (because of computer-aided creative design)

interesting how Cybernetic Serendipity is described, not an exhibition nor a technological fun fair. A hybrid perhaps?

The controversial questions: wether a computer thinks or wether it will replace man. Young audience would not think about that.

"The stronghold of art and technology is discouraged"...

2 texts in parallel:
Intellect has its own pleasure. but these are not a substitute for a direct emotional response.

To this day, not a single master piece made to the principles of generative aesthetics. ** Casey Reas

computer arts for those who are concerned with:
- permutational procedures
- serial techniques
- transformation of images

Instrument of democracy?
Abraham Moles dismisses the authenticity of a work of art ..

foreigners, computers and poets = unexpected linguistic associations
