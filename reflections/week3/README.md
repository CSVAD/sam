## Reflection on Design as exploration: creating interface alternatives through parallel authoring and runtime tuning by Bj√∂rn Hartmann, Loren Yu, Abel Allison, Yeonsoo Yang, and Scott R. Klemmer. (2008)

This article makes me reflect on my own practice as an artist and my lack of prototyping. When I tackle a project, I rarely think of the system of possibilities and try to work toward one object. Reading this case study on _Juxtapose_, I feel that "understanding [the] design space" would benefits my creative process. This seems so obvious, but when I make a piece, I don't think of the other ones I could have done. But doing so, can reveal the limits and the advantages of an artwork.

The parametrization of programming variables, using external controlling device, makes sense to me. But when an artwork is material-based, how do you manage parameters? I am interested in sculptural and performative works, but how does one think of parallel alternatives in such context? Rethinking creation in terms of these alternatives instead of final product could modify how I interact with these medium. In installation art, using cheap and reusable material could help achieve this goal. Another way would be to design my own building blocs, LEGO style! This reminds me of the designer [Cas Holman](https://casholman.com/projects#/rigamajig/), who designs smart and modular toys for kids.


One key element to keep in mind, which the authors are pushing forward, is this idea, that alternative paths must remain accessible visually for the users in order to make enlightened design decision. A question remains, is it preferable to set up these alternatives in series or in parallel?
