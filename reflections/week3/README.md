## Reflection on Design as exploration: creating interface alternatives through parallel authoring and runtime tuning by Bj√∂rn Hartmann, Loren Yu, Abel Allison, Yeonsoo Yang, and Scott R. Klemmer. (2008)

This article makes me reflect on my own practice as an artist and my lack of prototyping. When I tackle a project, I rarely think of the system of possibilities and try to work toward one object. Reading this case study on _Juxtapose_, I feel that "understanding [the] design space" would benefit my creative process. This seems so obvious, but when I make a piece, I don't think of the other ones I could have done. But doing so can reveal the limits and the advantages of an artwork.

The parametrization of programming variables, using an external controlling device, makes sense to me. But when an artwork is material-based, how do you manage parameters? I am interested in sculptural and performative works, but how does one think of parallel alternatives in such context? Rethinking creation in terms of these alternatives instead of the final product could modify how I interact with these medium. In installation art, using cheap and reusable material could help achieve this goal. Another way would be to design my own building blocks, LEGO style! This reminds me of the designer [Cas Holman](https://casholman.com/projects#/rigamajig/), who designs smart and modular toys for kids.


One key element to keep in mind, which the authors are pushing forward, is this idea, that alternative paths must remain accessible visually for the users in order to make enlightened design decisions. A question remains, is it preferable to set up these alternatives in series or in parallel? Hartmann and _al._ tested it with different devices, but how can we test it with non-computer-based medium?



## Reflection on Design galleries: a general approach to setting parameters for computer graphics and animation by J. Marks, B. Andalman, P. A. Beardsley, W. Freeman, S. Gibson, J. Hodgins, T. Kang, B. Mirtich, H. Pfister, W. Ruml, K. Ryall, J. Seims, and S. Shieber. (1997)  

Does _Design Gallery TM_ still exist? I could only find this article. This seems to be the best way to reach compelling graphics. I still often encounter that issue of having only on final render and no (rendering and actual) time to try different combinations. _DG_ can at least provide the automatization of "trying things out". The authors did it for lighting, color, and animation, so this technique can definitely be applied to many fields of graphic work.

The mathematical parametrization using distances, dispersion, and arrangement to define the available choices is clever and pragmatic. It formalizes the creative process which supports the artist or designer in their decision making. This trend of thinking about art and designing is new for me, at least in this academic way, and I am very excited to give it a go!
