Exploring minim on Processing.

Design metaphore;
- each line an instrument with some characteristics depending of its physionomy.

What could be sonified:
- ADSR
- additive synthesis
    - with varying amount of partial depending of the weight stroke?
- wavetable stacking technic: "When four to eight complex waveforms can be staked, deep and rich hybrid tectures can be created for each sound event." (Roads, 1996)
- how to embrace reverb?
- granular synthesis
    - the envelope of the grain modifies its sonic qualities (Roads, 1996).

Taking a pen and paper to prototype.

I just finished reading Golan Levin [thesis]{https://acg.media.mit.edu/people/golan/thesis/thesis300.pdf}. His thesis follows his thorough process of design, from inspiration to creation. He is critical about previous work and about his own, which gives me a lot of insights regarding directions to take or not to take. More on this later.

**Questions emerged form the reading:**
- Where/what is the reader? A movable rectangle like in [_Yellowtail_]{http://www.flong.com/projects/yellowtail/} or an abstracted timeline based on the line's length like in _Loom_ (Levin, c. 1999)? Or something else?
- How can I use 3 dimensions sonically?
- How could I develop grouping behaviors between the lines in order to develop a choir like system?
- Could adding physics to the process be interesting visually and sonically?
- Could sonifying textures be relevant?
- How can the user erase visual/sonic events? Without clearing the whole frame?
