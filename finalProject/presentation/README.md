## final presentation
- prepare a 7 minute presentation on their final project for the day of the critique.

- The presentation should include the following elements.

### Product
i.e. what you made:
Show images, videos, or a live demonstration of your final project. Choose a form that best corresponds with highlighting the key elements of your project. If you produced a generative series, Note that if you opt for a live demonstration, it's usually a good idea to have backup recorded footage of a successful run since bugs and crashes happen.

**Description:** first attempt to create a gestural drawing tool that enables sound composition and behavioral animation.






### Concept and Motivation
i.e why you made it:
Clearly describe your project idea and the motivation behind it. This may include, but is not limited to - the kinds of art or design ideas you were seeking to express, the types of people you were interested in supporting, and specific technical challenges you were attempting to take on. If your idea builds off or is inspired by prior work, describe how your work extends or differs from what has been done before.

My range of gestural behaviors using the line as a basic unit of composition is represented in the image above. Each of these lines requires a specific gesture to be accomplished. In that sense, the drawing process is deeply **performative**, drawing is in part a choreographic encounter that leaves a trace on a surface. This part of the process is rarely put forward.

Design metaphor: creating a context that needs to be perpetually maintain in order to persist visually and sonically in time.

Animation behaviors to enable


### Process
i.e. how you made it:
Provide an overview of the process you took in completing your final project. This should include the following:

1) a discussion of specific challenges you encountered during the process and how you addressed them,

2) how your concept and motivation evolved throughout the course of working on the project, and
Basic unit: the line

Identification of the potential gestural parameters
- length of the line
- pressure of the  pencil
- curvature of the line
- speed of the drawing process

Sound features to map
- frequency and amplitude
-
- filters' parameters

Behaviors
- queue (FIFO)
- stack (FILO)
- disappearance through alpha
-

3) what you learned through the process. For projects that focus on a particular algorithm (generative series, ML based approaches, etc.) your discussion of process should include an overview of your algorithm functionality.
