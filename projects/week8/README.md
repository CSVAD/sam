## plotter drawing

**What new challenges or constraints did the plotter add when creating computational art and design?**
Technically, the plotter requires vector format images, therefore, one needs to consider making visuals that follow this requirement. In my case, I wanted to be able to superimpose shapes, using the fill color from Processing and exporting my sketch as PDF would not have allowed that. I had to use Adobe Illustrator to trace the bitmap version of my sketch.

Furthermore, with the plotter, time is a constraint. One drawing can take a few hours, so if you make a mistake, the consequences are greater than simply running your sketch again. Also, each color must have its own file and one must reset the plotter to its origin for every new color. It is reminiscent of serigraphy techniques and can give a unique result, but remains time-consuming.


**What new expressive opportunities (if any) did the plotter offer over screen-based output?**
The material used with the plotter offers new opportunities. I experimented with different types of pens to finally select a black Staedtler fineliner that is affected by the grain of the paper. This pen creates lines that are slightly wiggling, giving a hesitating aesthetic to the drawing. It also creates a very delicate drawing compare to thicker and inkier pens.

Moreover, the paper transparency in front of light enabled me to draw on both sides of the Bristol paper. This gives some new illusions of depth that could not be achieved so gracefully.
