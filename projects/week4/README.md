## generative

I wanted to visualize 3d perlin noise, so I began by creating a tridimensional array of little cubes to witch I apply a color based on the _noise()_ function.   Each little cubes is a unit. Its position can be modified by its color value in x, y and z.

The parametrization of this small experience is similar to last week assignment. I use rotation and have an option to avoid erasing the background, which creates a complex shape in time.  

Doing so, I realized that some of the configurations would generate a well textured 3d surface.
