## figurative color picker

I was inspired by the work of Kimiko Ryokai, [I/O Brush](https://vimeo.com/44538204), to explore hybrid shapes using the webcam as an input. My version is pretty basic and consists of using a square-shaped brush to uncover the video feed coming from the webcam. This video feed changes as objects and people around the computer. Therefore, the visual output is made of combinations of different past states.

This tool allows the user to decide the number of bytes used per color. This asset can be used to define a subset of colors one could describe an object or a scene with. I would see myself using such a tool in order to define a few colors to use in redrawing a specific object or a person in Photoshop for instance.
