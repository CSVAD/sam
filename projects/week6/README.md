## color picker
Using Processing, create a simple user interface that enables a person to create a simple color palette. Your only restriction is that it cannot resemble an existing color picker UI (i.e. the ones found in Photoshop etc.)

You may incorporate conventional UI elements from the controlP5 library including buttons, drop-downs, and sliders.

You may also create your own interface elements and interactions as demonstrated in the code examples shown in class.

Choose a form of input for determining the color. You can sample based on the mouse position, generate random variations by incorporating noise, or map external data from sound or video to color values.

You might also consider the ways in which the color picker enables a person to compare or organize colors.

You can also choose to constrain the range of colors a person can select from.

Once you've created your color picker, write a brief description the design principles behind it. What audience is it intended for? What practices are you trying to support? (e.g. exploration? fine-grained control? comparison between alternatives?) How did you approach balancing ease of use with control and expressiveness?
