## regularity


I wanted to create a wallpaper that would admit a sense of depth (at least for the human mind!). I have always been really interested in architecture plans and wanted to explore this type of building representation using recursion. Procedural architecture can bring new ways to understand the space.

I began this exercise using organic skin patterns in order to create an uncanny texture but was not very compelled by the results. I went back to basic shapes and try to create a cityscape using quadrilateral shapes. So I made a first recursive function that would display trapezoids rotated 20Ëš in order to give perspective to the scene. I made a few more functions in order to complexify the image. From there, it was just a matter of tweaking variables in order to arrive at a (subjectively) interesting composition. I finished by adding a different shade of grey to each plane depending on their orientation.
