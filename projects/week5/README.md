## performative drawing tool

I was really inspired by the idea of creating a tool that was proper to the computational medium that we discussed in class following Bret Victor's reading. And I'm HUGE fan of [Norman](https://normanvr.com/) from the artist and programmer James Paterson. I started, therefore, with giving the drawer the ability to draw in tridimensional space using rotation of the world for doing so. This feature is somewhat limited since the drawer can only draw on planes tangent to the center of rotation (here, the middle of the canvas), but a further version could involve translation as well.

I wanted to be able to perform with this tool, therefore, I included an animation feature. So far, this feature redraw the line back and forth creating a loop. Since each line has a different amount of vertices, the animated drawing is continually changing state. Though, I enjoy traditional animation, I always found popular tools cumbersome. A simpler one with more constraints could allow for more smoothness in the process.

### Important notes
- Press on the 1 key to animate the drawing.
- Press on the 2 key to rotate the world automatically.
- Use WASD keys to rotate the world manually by increment of 5 degree.
